I had an unforgettable encounter. That was in a train, a middle-aged man sitting next to me started to talk and asked me if I had a question. The train was heading to countryside from the center of Tokyo. I was in love and excited to see my girlfriend. As a teenager, I asked him if he had faced any turning point. He answered there was a moment to choose a work or wife. “I chose my wife,” he laughed. As if in the current society, we wouldn’t be able to choose both of them.
