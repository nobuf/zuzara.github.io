In December 2005, I met In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust at a public library in Tokyo. The library is near a park where I used to bike often. I biked there at that day too. After passing through the busy main street with young pop culture enthusiasts, there’s an old building among trees in a shade of tall buildings. The Search sat in a bookshelf with all 13 volumes showing its light blue spine. I picked up the first volume and read an introduction by translator. He explained that some volumes are actually boring, and by contrast how wonderful the ending is. I was curious. Besides, I liked the title. I was seeking myself badly at that time. I didn’t know what I should do nor what I love to do. I thought that the book might tell me a key to solve my problem. So, I started the journey.

It’s December 2012 now, and I’m about to read the Search again. I’ve been waiting for the revisiting so long. I barely remember the details. The impact is not fresh anymore. I just know that it drastically changed the way how I see my life. If I consciously try to remember, a blur image will come up, at my old apartment sitting on a tatami floor, put the book on a coffee table, leaned back and closed my eyes, and I was shocked by flooding enormous amount of impression I never experienced. The Search is like a mirror, mountain or marathon. I’ve been trained myself to be ready, and it chose the timing to face. I’m 7 years older than before with the same length of memories. This time, I’m reading it in a foreign language. I had an important moment this year when I realized, rather, it was more likely deciding with being full of fear, that what I love to do.

So, anyways, here I am.
