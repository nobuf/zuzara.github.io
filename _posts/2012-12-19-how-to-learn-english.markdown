We’re learning English as a second language, for most of us, as a foreign language, in San Francisco. We are adults, so it’s challenging to acquire a new language. How do we and you learn English?

### As Long As Possible

How long do you use English in a day? Everyone agrees that we should use English 24/7, though it’s not easy even if you’re in San Francisco. How can we use English more than we do now? If your smartphone runs in your first language, just change it. That’s the start.

### Care Your Pronunciation

When you speak, you should be very careful. Make sure you pronounce correctly for every single word you utter. When you’re not sure you murmur. That’s not good at all. You must speak up. Louder is better. Grammar is important too. Even while texting, you should write perfectly, in my opinion. Interestingly, if you record your conversation you actually are able to correct mistakes by yourself.

Pretend as if you were an American. Imitate native speakers saying, face expressions and gestures. Care your pronunciation because people praise your proper accent. That adds fuel you to learn more. It makes you confident. Oh, you speak English well. What’s your answer? Forget about being humble. Being confident is extremely important.

### Rebuild Your Vocabulary

Probably you learned English with your first language. Each English word might be connected to a word in your first language. If that’s the case, it’s time to rebuild them in all English. There’s no time to translate into another language when you speak. What is dog? A common animal with four legs, fur, and a tail. (ref. [Longman][longman-dog]) You should be able to describe everything in English with easy words. Using English-English dictionary is crucial to achieve it.

### Being Passionate

Being fluent is just one of the steps you’d like to achieve. It’s not the final goal. You want to do something with English skill. But learning English takes a lot of time and very frustrating. You need some motivated learners friends. Talking with fluent speakers who got a job here would be another way to get inspired. They are your role model. Be passionate about learning. Being around passionate people is the best way to become passionate.

### So, Here We Are

Learning English is hard. I’ve been struggling for almsot 4 years, so while I’m learning, would love to help new learners.

San Francisco is such a wonderful place to live. You never be bored. Interesting thing is happening everyday in the city. Don’t be stuck with the routine. You won’t feel any improvement. Get out of your comfortable zone. I know it’s not easy. But there are many opportunities to make learning fun. A lot of fun.

Beyond all the efforts, there are some things we can discuss. We can exchange our cultures. We can get new perspectives. We can discuss about our future. If you allow me to have a big mouth, I would say that’s the start to make the planet a little better place to live.
