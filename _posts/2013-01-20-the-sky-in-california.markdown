A man came to my apartment in Tokyo with a small truck. I was about to move, and I gave all my furniture and things to him. Two suitcases were left in my hands. Coincidentally, he had lived in Los Angeles for ten years. I was curious the reason of his living abroad. He answered that he just wanted to live in America. He added that I should take a flight training. It must be a few decades ago, he had flown a plane in California where I was heading to.
