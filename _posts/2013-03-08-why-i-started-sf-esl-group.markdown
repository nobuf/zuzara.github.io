When I was about to leave to my country after 6 months stay as an ESL student, a friend of mine said to me see you soon. See you soon. As if it was just another everyday goodbye. I wanted to come back. I wanted to say I’m back. I got something important. As you know me living in San Francisco, luckily, thankfully, I could keep my promise.

In early 2012, Daniel and I were looking for a new gig, and found that Meetup.com offered 50% off discount. I liked Meetup.com very much and wanted to be an organizer. Since many friends helped me to learn English I had been thinking that I should pay it forward someday. So far, there was no reason not to start. Soon after I started the group, I realized that this is it. I knew what should I do. I had been struggling to find opportunities to practice speaking. I wanted a place where I can use English as long as I want. I wasn’t sure how to study. I needed a mentor and role model. What the group provides now are what I wanted as a learner.

It’s been great with awesome members, and I know we can improve the group activities more and more. I believe we have the potential to become the best place to learn English.

I’m very happy when I notice that members use new phrase. It will be my great honor if members find lifelong friends in the group. It’s not easy to meet again once one left to his/her country, but I’ve already seen more than a few pictures of members’ reunion in another country. And, yes, I’d like to be the person who says “see you soon” when they’re leaving.
